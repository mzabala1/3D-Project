# 3D-Project
3D Project developed to the subject Graphic Computing.

In this project we wanted to measure the knowledge of the students from the graphic computing class using a simple survey, and a simple game that implements the topics worked in class.

Made with Java using Vector4, Matrix4x4 with PolygonObjects. The PoliygonObjects has translation, rotation and scaling.

Compile with NetBeans and run the "Principal.java" class. Have fun :) !
